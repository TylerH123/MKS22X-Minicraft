Today was the first day of serious work on this project. We got more familiar
with how processing deals with keypresses, and implemented a "keypress" array to
keep track of which keys are being pushed at any given moment. We also worked on
a central "player" with the "world" moving around it. This is all implemented in
the graphics though, we need to revamp and move that logic into a lower more OO level
At home I worked on making the player rectangle lean in a direction to suggest that
it's the figure doing the action
